**JSON** is a lightweight data-interchange format originally created to hold structured data to be used in JavaScript.
*[JSON]: JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is:

- easy for humans to read and write.

- easy for machines to parse and generate.

- based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language.

- language independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers.

- the most common format for REST API responses.

- pronounced *jay-sAHn*.

REST APIs usually return information in XML or JSON format; however, JSON is used most often.
