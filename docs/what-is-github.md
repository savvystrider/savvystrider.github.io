# What is GitHub?

Previously, we learned that [Git](what-is-git.md) is an open source version control tool that tracks changes to files. So, what is GitHub? Are they the same thing?

No.

**GitHub** is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code. **Git** is the core technology that GitHub is built on top of.

    To best use GitHub, you'll need to set up Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. To effectively collaborate on GitHub, you'll write in issues and pull requests using GitHub Flavored Markdown.

GitHub offers three types of accounts:

- Personal accounts
- Organization accounts
- Enterprise accounts

At the very least, you will need to create a free personal account to create a repository or collaborate with others on a project.

You can interact with GitHub via its [website](https://www.github.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## What is a repository?

A **repository** is the most basic element of GitHub. A repository is like the "folder" of a project: it contains all of the files of a project, its documentation, and its revision history. Repositories can be public or private, and can host multiple collaborators.
