### Client
A computer used by a user to connect to a network and make requests to servers.

### CRUD

### HTTP
The underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them.

### HTTP header

### HTTP messages

### HTTP methods / verbs
Options given to a client for requesting or manipulating resources.

Options include: `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `CONNECT`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, and `PATCH`.

### HTTP request

### HTTP response

### Idempotent / idempotency
An HTTP method is idempotent if an identical request can be made more than once with the same effect *without* changing the state of the server. A `GET` method is considered idempotent. A `POST` (create) method is not considered idempotent.

### Protocol
A system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers.

### Server
A computer that serves many kinds of information to a user or client machine.

### Status code

### Stateless
In the client-server model, a stateless protocol means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

This is in contrast to a *stateful* protocol, which does keep data (state) between separate requests.

HTTP is a stateless protocol.
