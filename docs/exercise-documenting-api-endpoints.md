# Exercise: Documenting API endpoints for mock OpenWeatherMap assignment
For this exercise, imagine that you are a technical writer working with the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) team. The team has provided you with information on an internal wiki page that must be documented.

We will document this new information using the methods outlined by Tom Johnson in his course [Documenting APIs](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/).
