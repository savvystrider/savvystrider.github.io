# What is a GitHub repository?

!!! info

    A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

A repository can be owned by an individual or shared across an organization.

Access to a repository can be limited or made available to the public. This depends on the nature of the project.

## How do I create a new repository?

The easiest way to create a new repository is to go through this URL:

`https://github.com/new/`

    You can also click on the `+` button at the top of the page or click on the green **Create a new repository** button.

This takes you directly to the **Create a new repository** page. You have the option to use a **Repository template**. If you use a template, your new repository will include the contents of the template.

2. Choose an **Owner** of the repository. This is populated by default.
3. Create a short **Repository Name**.
4. Include a short description of your repository (optional).
5. Decide if you want your repository to be **Public** or **Private**.
6. Add a **README.md** file (optional). In the README file, you can include a longer description for your repository. This is useful if you make your repository public.
7. Add a **.gitignore** file (optional).
8. Click the green **Create repository** button.
