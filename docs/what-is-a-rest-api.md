So, what exactly is a **REST API**?

We know that API means "application programming interface," which is a hilarious way of describing how two computers communicate with each other.

It all boils down to the **client-server model**.

A **client** (a user or a computer) makes a request for a **resource** to a **server** (a computer built to hold and *serve* resources).

The server, then, sends a response back to the client.

In the case of REST APIs, the requests and responses are handled via HTTP, a communications protocol that standardizes the way in which requests and responses are made.
