# About

This is a website I made with Material for MkDocs, Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Visual Studio Code, and Markdown.

This website is primarily about the study of REST APIs and REST API documentation; however, many other topics are covered, including:

- [APIs](what-is-an-api.md) (in general)

- [Postman](what-is-postman.md)

- [Git](what-is-git.md)

- GitHub

- Static site generators

- Markdown

- [JSON](what-is-json.md)

- [XML](what-is-xml.md)

- [cURL](what-is-curl.md)

- and more!

My study of REST APIs began with the course [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) by fellow technical writer Tom Johnson.

It then expanded to the course [Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers](https://www.udemy.com/course/api-documentation-1-json-and-xml/) by Peter Gruenbaum.

After that, things got pretty crazy.
