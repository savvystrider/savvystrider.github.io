# About

This is a website I made with Material for MkDocs, Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Markdown.

This website is primarily about the study of REST APIs and REST API documentation; however, many other topics are covered, including:

- APIs (in general)

- Postman

- Git

- GitHub

- Hugo / Jekyll / MkDocs

- Markdown

- JSON

- XML

- cURL

My study of REST APIs began with the course [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers and engineers](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) by fellow technical writer Tom Johnson.

It then expanded to the course [Learn API Technical Writing: JSON and XML for Writers](https://www.udemy.com/course/api-documentation-1-json-and-xml/) by Peter Gruenbaum.
