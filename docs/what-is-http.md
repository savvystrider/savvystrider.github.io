**HTTP** is a protocol for fetching resources, such as HTML documents.

HTTP follows a classical client-server model: a client opens a connection to make a *request*, then waits until a *response* is received from the server.

HTTP is a **stateless** protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

*[HTTP]: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
