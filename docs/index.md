Let's learn about APIs!

As a technical writer, I noticed how many jobs these days involve the documentation of APIs. Unfortunately, trying to understand what an API is felt too complicated. There are lots of different APIs and lots of explanations.

Plus, learning about APIs means you have to learn about things that are not APIs. If you're unfamiliar with programming or computer science, it can get a bit overwhelming.

For me, it helped to keep track of each individual branch of knowledge, with the hope that repetition would cause all of it to make sense at some point.
