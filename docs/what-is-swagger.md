# What is Swagger?

**Swagger** is a suite of API developer tools (open source, free, or commercially available) from SmartBear Software.

Swagger's open source tools include:

- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
- [Swagger Editor](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/)
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)

Its commercial, or Pro, tools include:

- SwaggerHub
- SwaggerHub Enterprise
- Swagger Inspector

Quite confusingly, the **Swagger Specification** is also the former name for the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/).

!!! info

    The OpenAPI Specification (aka the Spec) was originally based on the Swagger Specification, donated by SmartBear Software. Once the Spec was donated it became a separate project in 2016, overseen by the OpenAPI Initiative, an open source collaboration project of the Linux Foundation.
