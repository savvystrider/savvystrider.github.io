We know that API means \"application programming interface,\" which is a hilarious way of describing how two computers communicate with each other. It boils down to the client-server model . A client (a user or a computer) makes a request to a server (a computer built to hold and serve resources). The server, then, sends a response back to the client. In the case of REST APIs, the requests and responses are handled via HTTP, a communications protocol that standardizes the way in which requests and responses are made.","title":"What are REST APIs?"},{"location":"what-is-an-api/","text":"So, what exactly is an API? You can find out easily that API stands for \"application programming interface.\" But that doesn't tell you much. Is it an app? Is it a type of app? Is it in my phone? Is it watching me when I sleep? How come everytime I ask an engineer about it the explanation doesn't make any sense to me? These are all valid questions but the answer is surprisingly simple. An API is a set of rules for computers to communicate with each other. Yes, it really is that simple and that vague. The term API has been around for decades but the idea behind it is still basic: somewhere, out there, a computer holds information that another computer makes a request for. This is the technology that provides the backbone for apps (mobile, desktop, web) and the information exchanged between them. Think about the way you interact with technology. You can use your phone to request data, send data, update data, and, even, delete data. The technology you use for these requests has to be able to interpret your commands and share them with another computer. Today, when we use the term API, we're typically talking about a web API that makes a request for resources and expects a response in return.","title":"What are APIs?"},{"location":"what-is-an-endpoint/","text":"REST APIs focus on resources and how to access those resources. Resources are accessed through endpoints. An endpoint is the address (URL), or location , of the resource.

For example, you can specify (in a query parameter) that you want to limit the display to 5 instances of the resource (see example below).
